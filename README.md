Universal-gesture-remote
========================

This is a project under PES Open Source community. The aim was to build a gesture recognition wrist band capable of recognizing hand gestures of the user and hence control a number of day to day electronic devices wirelessly. The code in the Transmission folder is what runs on the ATmega 168 (present on the wrist band) using which gesture recognition and wireless IR communication is achieved. The code in the Receiver folder is what enables the Arduino to receive IR signals, decode them and perform the desired action.
